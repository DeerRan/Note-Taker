## Description  
It's a notepad! You can write, save, and delete notes.
## Demo

## Installation
Download it off github, open up the root folder in the terminal, and run "npm install" followed by "node server.js". Then you just have to open up localhost:3000 in your browser.
## Usage
You can write a title and a description of a note, formatted however you want. Press the pencil icon to open up a new note, or hit the floppy disc icon to save your note. You can also view older notes by clicking on the names of old notes in the list off to the left. Click the red trashcan to delete notes.
## Contribution
Not accepting any feedback or contributions! I'm just simply doing this for homework and do not plan on coming back to work further on the project. I do appreciate the thought however!
